# tangled-tiles

There's a viral game called Sumation doing the round about how some dude asked AI to design a game and then asked AI to build it and it's actually a pretty playable.

I thought I'd have a go, so I asked CHATGTP "Can you please suggest 10 ideas for original puzzle games?"

It paused for a moment and said, "Happy to do that" and spat out a list" which I quickly read and one caught my eye "Tangled Tiles. Connect up letters to solve the puzzle"

I said, "can you built me that in HTML and Javascript?"

And the device said, "I can" and it did and it spat out about 2k of HTML with embedded Javascript which I then proceeded to copy to my local disk so I could load it up in a browser.

So it presented me with a screen say 5x5 of random letters.

B N Q H Y

A B E I O 

Q B R T P

M H F E U 

And it also offered me a score which started as zero.

Excited to play this game I clicked a the letter Q and the letter rotated 90 degrees.

B N ℺ H Y

A B E I O 

Q B R T P

M H F E U 

And not only this my score went down to -1.

I continued to click and one by one I could click all of the letters until they were on one side with my score going down by 1 each time.

Now, I can't really explain it but this put me into almost a comedy trance where this appeared to be the funniest thing I've ever experienced.

This is AIs idea of a good game. A game where you can only click letters, lay them out on their side and score negative points for it.

The only winning move is not to play --> https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/robmanuel/tangled-tiles/blob/master/index.html
